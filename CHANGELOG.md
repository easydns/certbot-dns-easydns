Change notes for certbot-dns-easydns
====================================

### v0.1.0: Initial version
	- Largely based on plugins for ISPConfig, DNSMadeEasy, DNSimple
	- Uses Lexicon which support EasyDNS as a provider.
	- Requires that EasyDNS is the DNS provider for the domain to be
      used.  Customers may register to receive access to the REST API
      which is required for this Authenticator to work.
