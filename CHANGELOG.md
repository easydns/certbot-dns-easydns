====================================

### v0.1.0: Initial version
	- Largely based on plugins for ISPConfig, DNSMadeEasy, DNSimple
	- Uses Lexicon which support EasyDNS as a provider.
	- Requires that EasyDNS is the DNS provider for the domain to be
      used.  Customers may register to receive access to the REST API
